# Java-Script-Program


This is a java script I made when I was a freshman.  When you press the "Press" botton, first you can see a Japanse word, and when you press second time, you can see the translation of the word in English.

I would like to improve this Java Script for the Japanese leaners.  Please give me any suggestion and reaction if you have.

Thank you.
